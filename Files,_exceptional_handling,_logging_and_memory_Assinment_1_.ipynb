        "Python’s garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory, i.e., reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. It combines reference counting with a cycle-detecting garbage collector to handle complex cases. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reference Counting**\n",
        "\n",
        "Every Python object keeps track of the number of references pointing to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the reference count drops to zero, the object is no longer accessible and can be deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "b = a      # reference count increases\n",
        "del a      # reference count decreases\n",
        "del b      # reference count becomes 0 → object is garbage collected\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitation: Reference counting alone cannot handle circular references (objects referencing each other).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Generational Garbage Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "To handle circular references, Python uses a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python categorizes objects into three generations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 0 – Newly created objects\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 1 – Survived one garbage collection\n",
        "\n",
        "Generation 2 – Survived multiple garbage collections\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects in older generations are collected less frequently, which improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How GC Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The garbage collector periodically checks for unreachable objects (those that cannot be accessed by any references).\n",
        "\n",
        "If objects are part of a reference cycle and are unreachable, GC frees their memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gc module allows you to interact with the garbage collector:\n",
        "\n",
        "import gc\n",
        "\n",
        "gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also inspect objects that are tracked by the garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Manual Resource Cleanup\n",
        "\n",
        "For non-memory resources (like files or network connections), use with statements or explicit cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Garbage collection only handles memory; it does not automatically release system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary\n",

        "Reference Counting: Deletes objects when reference count is zero.\n",

        "Closing a file in Python is very important because it ensures that all resources used by the file are properly released and that data is safely written to disk. Here’s a detailed explanation:\n",

        "1. Flushes Data to Disk\n",
        "\n",
        "When writing to a file, Python buffers the data in memory before actually writing it to disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calling file.close() flushes the buffer, ensuring that all data is saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
        "file.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
        "file.close()  # Ensures data is actually written\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Releases System Resources\n",
        "\n",
        "Every open file consumes system resources (file descriptors).\n",
        "\n",
        "Not closing files can lead to resource leaks, which may crash programs or limit the number of files that can be opened.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoids Data Corruption\n",
        "\n",
        "If a program terminates unexpectedly or a file is not closed, data may be lost or corrupted.\n",

        "Properly closing files ensures the file integrity is maintained.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Ensures Proper Behavior Across Platforms\n",
        "\n",
        "On some operating systems, files remain locked until closed, which can prevent other programs from accessing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing the file releases the lock and makes it available for other processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Using with Statement (Recommended)\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides a context manager (with statement) to handle files automatically.\n",
